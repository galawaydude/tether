# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Design authority

The product spec, stack rationale and the ordered PR breakdown for Milestone 1 live outside
this repo at `/home/galawaydude/Documents/Projects/firstmate/data/tether-arch/report.md`.
It is the result of verified empirical work — do not re-litigate the stack choices from it.
`README.md` carries the parts a user needs; the report carries the reasoning.

## Commands and layout

See the Development section of `README.md`. All checks are in root `package.json` scripts and
CI runs exactly those (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Sharp edges

- **`shared/` is types only.** It emits `.d.ts` and no JavaScript, and its `prepare` script
  builds it on `npm ci` so `tsc --noEmit` works on a fresh clone. Import from it with
  `import type`; `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces that.
- **Each package has two tsconfigs**: `tsconfig.json` (noEmit) and a second one for the files
  it does not cover — `tsconfig.build.json` where the package emits, and `web/tsconfig.node.json`
  for web's Node-side files (`vite.config.ts` and the tests). Web's `tsconfig.json` is the
  browser program: `types: []` plus that split is what keeps Node globals out of it, since
  vite's own declarations pull `@types/node` into any program containing `vite.config.ts`.
  `tsc --noEmit` at the repo root is not configured — use `npm run typecheck`.
- **TypeScript is pinned to 5.x.** TypeScript 7 is released but `typescript-eslint` still
  peers on `<6.1.0`; upgrading TS ahead of that breaks `npm install`.
- **npm 12 blocks dependency install scripts by default.** A dependency that silently fails
  to build is usually this; approve it with `npm install-scripts approve <pkg>`. Nothing in
  the current tree needs it. `node-pty` (PR #6) will — it ships no Linux prebuild, so it
  needs both an install-script approval and a native toolchain.
- **Every tmux command goes through `server/src/machine/tmux.ts`.** It carries
  `-L <socket> -f tether.conf` on _every_ invocation, so whichever command starts the
  server starts it with tether's config. `tether.conf` is a non-TS asset, so `tsc` does
  not copy it — `server`'s `build` script does, and anything that moves the file must
  move that `cp` too. The reason for each rule is in the module's own comments; the
  traps they defend against are in report §2/§3/§7.
- **Tests run straight from TypeScript** via `node --test` and Node's built-in type
  stripping. There is no test build step; relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
