# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Design authority

The product spec, stack rationale and the ordered PR breakdown for Milestone 1 live outside
this repo at `/home/galawaydude/Documents/Projects/firstmate/data/tether-arch/report.md`.
It is the result of verified empirical work — do not re-litigate the stack choices from it.
`README.md` carries the parts a user needs; the report carries the reasoning.

## Commands and layout

See the Development section of `README.md`. All checks are in root `package.json` scripts and
CI runs exactly those (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Sharp edges

- **`shared/` is types only.** It emits `.d.ts` and no JavaScript, and its `prepare` script
  builds it on `npm ci` so `tsc --noEmit` works on a fresh clone. Import from it with
  `import type`; `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces that.
- **Each package has two tsconfigs**: `tsconfig.json` (noEmit) and a second one for the files
  it does not cover — `tsconfig.build.json` where the package emits, and `web/tsconfig.node.json`
  for web's Node-side files (`vite.config.ts` and the tests). Web's `tsconfig.json` is the
  browser program: `types: []` plus that split is what keeps Node globals out of it, since
  vite's own declarations pull `@types/node` into any program containing `vite.config.ts`.
  `tsc --noEmit` at the repo root is not configured — use `npm run typecheck`.
- **TypeScript is pinned to 5.x.** TypeScript 7 is released but `typescript-eslint` still
  peers on `<6.1.0`; upgrading TS ahead of that breaks `npm install`.
- **npm 12 blocks dependency install scripts by default.** A dependency that silently fails
  to build is usually this; approve it with `npm install-scripts approve <pkg>`. Nothing in
  the current tree needs it. `node-pty` (PR #6) will — it ships no Linux prebuild, so it
  needs both an install-script approval and a native toolchain.
- **`npx tether` only works because `server`'s `prepare` builds during `npm ci`.** npm links
  workspace bins before install finishes and skips a bin whose target is missing, so
  `dist/cli.js` has to exist by then — and it has to carry the exec bit itself, which is why
  `build` ends in `chmod +x`. `prepare` builds `@tether/shared` first: npm runs the two
  workspace `prepare` scripts in the wrong order otherwise and `server`'s `tsc` cannot find
  the declarations.
- **Every tmux command goes through `server/src/machine/tmux.ts`.** It carries
  `-L <socket> -f tether.conf` on _every_ invocation, so whichever command starts the
  server starts it with tether's config. `tether.conf` is a non-TS asset, so `tsc` does
  not copy it — `server`'s `build` script does, and anything that moves the file must
  move that `cp` too. The reason for each rule is in the module's own comments; the
  traps they defend against are in report §2/§3/§7.
- **tmux 3.7 is a hard floor.** `tether.conf` sets `window-size manual`, and tmux
  before 3.7 sizes a not-yet-created window through a NULL pointer, so every detached
  `new-session` dies with `server exited unexpectedly`. Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.4, hence
  the source build in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. That message from any tmux command
  means the tmux on `PATH` is too old, not that the argv was wrong.
- **All persistent state is one SQLite file outside the repo**, opened by
  `server/src/db.ts` — `~/.local/state/tether/tether.sqlite`, file `0600` in a `0700`
  directory (`$XDG_STATE_HOME`, or `$TETHER_STATE_DIR`, which tests and any manual run
  must set rather than touch the real one). Never write runtime state into the repo; a
  path that is not in the repo cannot be committed by accident. `db.ts` owns the path
  and the mode bits — `machine/registry.ts` only adds its schema on top, applied on
  every open (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). There is no migration framework, so a
  column added later must be added compatibly. `provider_session_id` is deliberately
  nullable: Codex has no session identity until the first user message, so the row is
  provisional from spawn and back-filled. Rows are marked dead, never deleted — PR #12
  resumes from them.
- **Tests run straight from TypeScript** via `node --test` and Node's built-in type
  stripping. There is no test build step; relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.
- **HTTP routes are default-deny.** A `preParsing` hook in `server/src/web/server.ts` rejects
  every request without a valid session unless the route sets `config: { public: true }`.
  It runs before body parsing, so an unauthenticated caller reaches neither the body parser
  nor a 404 that would tell it which paths exist.
  Adding a route therefore protects it automatically — and marking one public is a security
  decision, not a convenience. Reaching any route is equivalent to a shell on the machine.
  This covers HTTP only: the WebSocket upgrade in PR #6 must repeat the cookie, `Host` and
  `Origin` checks itself, because an upgrade carries cookies but is not covered by CORS.
- **Fastify's schema defaults silently repair a bad body** (`removeAdditional` and
  `coerceTypes` are on): `additionalProperties: false` strips instead of rejecting, and
  `{"password": 123}` arrives as `"123"`. `buildServer` turns both off. Do not remove that
  `ajv.customOptions` block, and do not assume stock Fastify behaviour when reading the tests.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
