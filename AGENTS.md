# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Design authority

The product spec, stack rationale and the ordered PR breakdown for Milestone 1 live outside
this repo at `/home/galawaydude/Documents/Projects/firstmate/data/tether-arch/report.md`.
It is the result of verified empirical work — do not re-litigate the stack choices from it.
`README.md` carries the parts a user needs; the report carries the reasoning.

## Commands and layout

See the Development section of `README.md`. All checks are in root `package.json` scripts and
CI runs exactly those (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Sharp edges

- **`shared/` is types only.** It emits `.d.ts` and no JavaScript, and its `prepare` script
  builds it on `npm ci` so `tsc --noEmit` works on a fresh clone. Import from it with
  `import type`; `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces that.
- **Each package has two tsconfigs**: `tsconfig.json` (noEmit, includes tests) and, where the
  package emits, `tsconfig.build.json` (excludes tests). `tsc --noEmit` at the repo root is
  not configured — use `npm run typecheck`.
- **TypeScript is pinned to 5.x.** TypeScript 7 is released but `typescript-eslint` still
  peers on `<6.1.0`; upgrading TS ahead of that breaks `npm install`.
- **npm 12 blocks install scripts by default.** Packages needing them are listed under
  `allowScripts` in root `package.json` (`esbuild`, for Vite). A dependency that silently
  fails to build is usually this. `node-pty` (PR #6) will need the same treatment plus a
  native toolchain — it ships no Linux prebuild.
- **Tests run straight from TypeScript** via `node --test` and Node's built-in type
  stripping. There is no test build step; relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
